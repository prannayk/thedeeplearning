# The Deep Learning repo
After going through hundreds of papers, under graduates finally decide what they think is the best approach to the problem they are working on. But all said and done, one of the most challenging tasks is to get good code (which works, ofc) to be available for a lot of the previous work that is being attacked. 

End result : we often re invent the wheel. This repo is exactly the same thing, but for a varied amount of code. It is just a side project I am doing to get my hands dirty with the things I am interested in. 

## Modules :
1. GAN and variants : GAN, EBGAN, WGAN ( under construction )
2. Word + Character level LSTM models ( coming soon )
